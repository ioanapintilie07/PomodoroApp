##Pomodoro App

The app will give the user information about the Pomodoro Technique - work is divided into 25 minute long sprees (or pomodoros) with a 5 minute break between them, and a 20 minute one every four pomodoros. The option to choose a work goal will be offered. The app will then automatically set up timers, following the described cycle, and inform the user when the goal has been reached.
